Doug is the type of guy webscraper 

After Doug Demuro mentioned that he wished he had started writing down some of the "Doug is the type of guy" comments (see reddit AMA), I decided to make a youtube comment webscraper to create a database of these comments.

I'll periodically update the spreadsheet this site is linked to with new comments: https://sites.google.com/view/dittog/home

Usage: main.py searches videos.csv for video links and goes through each video, generating comments.csv
I'll clean up the code and make it easier to use with more options, to allow the easy addition of new comments from new videos.
